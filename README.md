**Song Popularity Prediction**

**Introduction**<br>
Songs and music have become an integral part of our lives as they are great stressbusters, brain stimulators and provide fun and entertainment to both the young and old alike. Around 7.11 billion people listen to music, out of which, an average person listens to 961 hours and 10 minutes of music per year. Mobile and Web applications such as Spotify and Billboard Hot 100 use charts to show the top songs of the week or month. They also tack the listening habits of the users to recommend songs that they or users with listening habits similar to them would like. Although these recommendations are filtered by region, genre, and more other categories, they are still missing a lot of the variables. Variables such as age group and language (as most of the top song are in the English language) are commonly overlooked. Through this project, I will be able to consider some more variables that could have an impact on the popularity.

**Aim**<br>
The main objective of this Machine Learning model is to predict song popularity using different factors such as liveliness and danceability to name a few. Predicting these factors can have a significant impact on both songwriters and listeners. It would help songwriters to analyse and create music that would help them to gain popularity by attracting more listeners. Similarly, this would also help listeners to find and explore songs that they would want to listen to more easily.
